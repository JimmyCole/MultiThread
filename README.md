# MultiThread
The multi-thread version

Hello, this project tries to implement the multi-thread version of an interesting framework.

I have uploaded the detail codes about it, and the instruction about how to run and compile it.
Also, I uploaded a very simple example. You can have a try!

However, this project has not been totally completed, Which means, only the mode 1 and mode 2 (seq and nonSIMD version)can be used and tested. Anyway, the rest should be completed soon. 

Hope you can enjoy it~
